/**
 * Gate: the private recording store may never appear in this repository.
 *
 * The Association keeps one private evidence store: rail transaction exports, the officer
 * and buyer attestations made at checkout, sanctions-screening results, the terms version
 * each buyer accepted, and an append-only log tying them to the artifacts that were
 * published. It is classified P2-financial with P3-restricted elements, retained ten years,
 * and its governing requirement is one sentence long: NEVER IN PUBLIC REPOSITORIES. This
 * repository is public today.
 *
 * It is the CONTRACT repository, which is the specific way a leak could happen here: the
 * store has a shape, somebody writes that shape down, and the natural place to write a shape
 * down is next to the schemas. It would be the wrong place. Every schema here describes an
 * artifact a public surface serves; the private store's line schema describes something no
 * surface may ever serve, so it stays with the store, in the private ops area, and this gate
 * is what keeps the distinction from eroding one convenient commit at a time.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a content scanner. It matches PATH SHAPES, because that is how
 * the store actually arrives somewhere it should not be — copied in as itself, by an
 * operator moving a directory or a tool writing to the wrong root. Evidence pasted into the
 * body of a markdown file is a different failure with a different remedy (a human reading a
 * diff), and a gate that pretended to catch it would be trusted for something it cannot do.
 *
 * FOUR COPIES, DELIBERATELY. The same gate runs in all four of the organisation's
 * publishable repositories — the website, this one, the registry and the licence. They
 * publish separately and none may import from another, so the shared core below is
 * duplicated verbatim in all four and is meant to diff clean. The plumbing around it is each
 * repository's own, which is the part that legitimately differs.
 *
 * NOT A GITIGNORE RULE, deliberately: an ignore entry would hide a copied store from
 * `git status`, which is the moment it most needs to be visible.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-no-records.mjs [--root <dir>]
